# Having fun with Python3

Stand-alone code, including various algorithms and nice exercises.

-Sorting:
	Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Radix, Selection
	
	Benching all the above sorting algorithms.

-Misc:

	CheckParentheses.py:
		Checks string input for balanced parentheses (, [, {.

	Decorators.py:
		Stacked decorators to elaborate on their usage.

	GetPrimes.py:
		Given an integer n, return all prime numbers up to n.

	MergeRanges.py:
		Given a list of tuples, merge the overlapping ranges as shown: [(1,6), (0,5), (7,10)] -> [(0,6), (7,10)]

	PalindromicSubstrings.py:
		Finds longest palindromic substring using an O(n^2) implementation and Manacher's algorithm O(n), benchmarked.

	PrimeFactors.py:
		Given an integer n, return the prime factors of n. Two implementations, benchmarked.
